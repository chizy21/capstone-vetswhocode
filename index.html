        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello there, I am a Navy veteran, having served from 1985-1989. I
          started out as a Boatswains Mate (deckhand), and after failing down
          during one of my deployments, I was moved into Supply as a
          Storekeeper.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the Navy, I went on to work in the private sector as a Deputy
          Sheriff until my service-connected disability got to the point I could
          no longer serve. I decided to get into the computer field in desktop
          support.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a self taught IT guy, I moved up to helpdesk support, then landed a
          job at Compaq Server Division supporting Windows, Linux, Novell
          installations
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few years there, I then landed a job at the VA Hospital in
          Houston, TX in Network Admin. Here I setup and deployed Cisco routers
          and switches.

      <h2>How I ended up learning web development</h2>
      <p>
        From the days of AOL and MySpace, I self taught how to make simple
        websites using HTML only. I am a member of the DAV, VFW, American
        Legion, BVA, BVA-Bits. In these veteran service membership
        organizations, I have found that they all need websites to reach out to
        the younger generation of veterans. That is what led me to search fro
        some type of web development courses and I enrolled in Devslopes hoping
        that would work. But they are mostly you watch a video and then code
        along, not having any realtime way to ask questions outside of posting
        on their discord server.
